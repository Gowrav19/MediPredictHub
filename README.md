🧠 MediPredictAI – Intelligent Medical Prediction System

MediPredictAI is an AI-powered medical prediction system designed to assist in early disease detection and health risk assessment using machine learning techniques. The project analyzes patient data and predicts possible medical conditions, helping support faster and more informed healthcare decisions.

In addition to disease prediction, the system also includes an AI-powered chatbot assistant that interacts with users, answers health-related queries, and guides them through symptom input and result interpretation.

This system focuses on accuracy, usability, and scalability, making it suitable for academic projects, research, and real-world healthcare applications.

🚀 Key Features:

🩺 Predicts potential diseases based on patient health data

🤖 Machine Learning–based prediction models

📊 Data preprocessing and feature analysis

🌐 User-friendly interface for input and results

🔐 Secure handling of medical data

💬 AI Chatbot Assistant for user interaction and guidance

📈 Supports future model improvements and dataset expansion
